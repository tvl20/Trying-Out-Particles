This is a list of known bugs and potential future features that I thought of,
some points have a little description to go into detail if necessary.

- : not yet started.
~ : in progress (WIP)
+ : done (for now)
/ : stopped/dropped (for now)

Todo:
 + A boss enemy?
 - Improve enemy pathfinding
 - More spells/abilities
 - More enemies
 - No aiming reticle, you have to rely on your characters rotation to aim at something
 - No lock-on? not sure if I should add this or not keep changing my mind
 / Stop the camera from clipping through walls (after trying for 1.5 days I have given up, fix this later)

 + Give enemies HP bars
 + Visual representation of skills (like cooldown time remaining for example)
 + Enemies just kinda stand there like idiots doing nothing, give them behavior
 + Able to cast all the skills at the same time, this should be limited to casting 1 ability at a time
 + Player is able to move while casting a spell/using an ability, this shouldnt be happening? idk keep changing my mind on this
 + There is no "win" condition yet (also no "lose" condition :^)) so you have to close down with Alt+F4
 + No player health bar
 + Spells/abilities are not effected by the Y orientation of the camera 
   (^ this is not a bug but intended, but this ties in to the whole no reticle thing)
 + Dodge mechanic? dash?
